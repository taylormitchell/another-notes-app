Todo

- [x] Button in /lists to add new list (or open existing)
- [x] Button to add note above/between notes
- [ ] Adding notes to multiple lists isn't working. I think I need to fetch all the lists
      to make this not super slow. (re-think approach and do clean up)
- [ ] Dropdown in create modal to select lists
- [ ] Drag and drop notes between lists
- [ ] Create note below by pressing enter twice
- [ ] Why do I need `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED='0'` again? I think connecting to the db doesn't work without it. Feels unsafe though.
